# Form validation
This project incorporates comprehensive form validation techniques to ensure that user inputs are accurate, complete, and within the desired constraints. Proper form validation not only enhances the user experience by providing real-time feedback but also safeguards the integrity of the data collected through the forms.
Key Features

    Real-time Validation: The forms are equipped with real-time validation, where users receive instant feedback on the validity of their inputs as they type. This helps users correct errors before submitting the form.

    Input Sanitization: Input fields are sanitized to prevent potential security vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior caused by malicious input.

    Field-Level Validation: Each input field is validated individually, ensuring that specific requirements for each field (e.g., minimum and maximum length, valid email format, numeric values) are met.

    Custom Error Messages: Clear and user-friendly error messages are displayed when invalid inputs are detected. These messages guide users toward correcting the issues.
